        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Our hospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organisations (for-profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. Historically, our hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.
 Currently, our hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">teaching children about medical vocabulary and conversation at the doctor could be a great step towards making them less fearful about physicians and hospitals, which could translate in kids who are more comfortable about taking medicine or getting examined when needed.
            To start introducing this topic to the little ones, it’s advisable to start by telling them the importance of visiting the doctor’s office to check their health status and talking to them about the procedures that could be carried out there, such as checking up their ears, noses, and throats.</p>
